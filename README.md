# push_swap
Sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

### Subject's Summary:
 This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting

## Usage:
Just run  `make` a the root folder

## Push_swap

#### Example:
```
./push_swap 2 4 3
sa
ra
```


## Checker
A program that checks (from args) if an array of integers can be sorted with a given set of instructions (output from push_swap).
<br>
It outputs `OK` or `KO`

#### Example:
```
./checker 2 4 3
sa
ra
OK
```
<br>

### P.S.
Project requires push_swap to sort arrays of 500 integers and less.
